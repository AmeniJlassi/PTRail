# PTRail: A Parallel TRajectory dAta preprocessIng Library
PTRAIL is a state-of-the art Mobility Data Preprocessing Library that mainly deals with filtering data, generating features and interpolation of Trajectory Data.<br>
### The main features of PTRAIL are:

1.PTRAIL uses primarily parallel computation based on python Pandas and numpy which makes it very fast as compared to other libraries available.<br>
2.PTRAIL harnesses the full power of the machine that it is running on by using all the cores available in the computer.<br>
3.PTRAIL uses a customized DataFrame built on top of python pandas for representation and storage of Trajectory Data.<br>
4.PTRAIL also provides several Temporal and kinematic features which are calculated mostly using parallel computation for very fast and accurate calculations.<br>
5.Moreover, PTRAIL also provides several filteration and outlier detection methods for cleaning and noise reduction of the Trajectory Data.<br>
